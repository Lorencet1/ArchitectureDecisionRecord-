# Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks

# Title: Integration of Additional Technologies

# Status: Accepted

# Context
To enhance app functionality and meet specific requirements such as real-time updates, secure authentication, and efficient data processing, integrating additional frameworks and technology stacks is necessary.

# Decision
The project will integrate technologies including React for web components, Node.js for server-side operations, WebSockets for real-time communication, Stripe for payments, and OAuth for secure authentication.

# Consequences
These integrations offer powerful capabilities and flexibility for developing advanced features but require careful coordination and expertise in diverse technologies, potentially increasing the complexity of the project's technology stack.
