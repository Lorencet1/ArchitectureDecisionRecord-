# Data Storage

# Title: Data Storage Solution for Hybrid App

# Status: Accepted

# Context
Choosing an appropriate data storage solution is pivotal for managing user data, preferences, and app state effectively across multiple platforms.

# Decision
Firebase Firestore has been selected for data storage, offering real-time data synchronization, scalability, and ease of integration with both web and mobile clients.

# Consequences
Firestore provides a flexible, scalable cloud database solution that simplifies real-time data handling but introduces dependencies on Google Cloud services, requiring management of potential costs and considerations for data migration or interoperability with other systems.
