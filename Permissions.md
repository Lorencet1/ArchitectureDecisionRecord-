# Title: Strategy for Managing App Permissions

#Status: Accepted

#Context
Efficient management of app permissions is crucial for accessing device features like geolocation, notifications, and background services, while also respecting user privacy and platform policies.

#Decision
The app will implement a just-in-time permissions model, requesting access only when a specific feature requires it, accompanied by clear explanations of the permission's purpose to the user.

#Consequences
This strategy enhances user trust and meets platform guidelines but requires careful implementation to ensure a smooth user experience without disrupting the app's functionality
