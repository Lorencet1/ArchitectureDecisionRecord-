# Title: Selection of UI Framework for Hybrid App Development

# Status: Accepted

# Context
Developing a hybrid app requires a UI framework that can deliver an easy and responsive user experience across both web and mobile platforms.

# Decision
The decision is to use React Native for the UI framework given by its ability to enable cross-platform development from a single JavaScript codebase, ensuring efficient development and maintenance for both iOS and Android platforms

# Consequences
React Native's architecture and ecosystem allow for the creation of applications that are closer to native than traditional web-based hybrid apps, offering a compelling solution for many hybrid app development scenarios.
